# Motors-Control-System
It is a place to connect different motors with Arduino

Here I've learned and experimented with 3 types: Servo, DC and Steeper motors

In practice, I might have two types of it and tried it or what I lack equipment using simulation via proteus 8 professional and Tinkercad website
