Stepper motor control system with using Arduino Stepper Library

Task when the intern in Smart methods

The motor was simulated on a proteus 8

Explain How to run and simulate Arduino code in proteus 8

This code is taken from Arduino examples: Stepper Motor Control - one revolution

Note in the simulation was used L293D driver

In addition to practically, I am using 28BYJ-48 stepper and ULN2003 driver

The accessories:

Practically the connection that worked

But when using the battery on the Arduino or breadboard the motor did not rotate ?!
