 Two-servo motor control system 
 with using Arduino Servo Library
           
 Task when intren in Smart methods


The two engines were simulated on a TinkerCad
(GIF Simulation in Tinkercad to Two-servo motor control system.gif)


In addition to practically, but using a single motor to provide it at the present time to understand the experience
